    <h1>I'm Sorry.. I'll improve</h1>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1. Spark Fading:</strong> I’m sorry that somewhere along the way, the spark in our relationship feels like it has reduced. I know relationships need effort to keep the same warmth and excitement alive, and I realize I haven’t always done enough.</li>
      <li><strong>2. Taking Things for Granted:</strong> Sometimes I’ve let routine and comfort make me lazy, and I may not have shown the same energy or appreciation I used to. I never meant for it to feel like I was taking you for granted, but I understand how it could seem that way.</li>
      <li><strong>3. Lack of Effort in Small Things:</strong> I know I’ve missed out on doing the little things that once made us feel close and connected. Whether it’s expressing love, giving attention, or simply making time, I should have been more mindful.</li>
      <li><strong>4. Feeling Like I’m Losing Priority:</strong> These situations make me feel like I’m losing priority, and that’s my problem. I don’t think we’ve fought about anything else.</li>
      <li><strong>5. My Promise to You:</strong> I want you to know that my feelings haven’t changed—you’re still the most important person to me. I’ll put in genuine effort to bring back the joy, care, and passion we both deserve in this relationship.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>If I ever seem off, please understand it comes from care and not from anger.</p>
    
    <p><strong>I’m adjusting because I don’t want to lose us. If you ever feel the spark is fading, please tell me—I’d rather work on it than let it hurt you silently. I love you, and I’m ready to rebuild everything with you, step by step.</strong></p>
